# BRCI
Repository for the Middle SEBP BRCI, 2021

In this repository, the modeling script used to create the Middle SEBP BRCI is made available
Some aspects of the model required preprocessing outside of the script. These areas are captured in script comments and explained what preprocessing was required
The model's input data is made available in this repository (File GDB, contains all model inputs)

To reproduce, change the file paths for inputs and outputs to stored location of input data and desired output location
